This project is a demonstration of the topic “Underwater Swarm Localization with Acoustic Communication”. It involves the evaluation of two different schemes within the Ultra-Short Baseline (USBL) framework:  
✅ Static anchor scheme
✅ Dynamic anchor scheme  
The implementation shows how these two localization schemes can be used to determine the positions of multiple underwater vehicles (UUVs) in a simulated environment. It illustrates key challenges such as acoustic signal propagation, multipath interference, and synchronization.
